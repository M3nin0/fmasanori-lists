# fmasanori-lists
Masanori's Python exercises lists made with other languages

## Objective

Learn other languages based on Python exercises to differ and learn other languages.

## Collaboration

Each week there is a new list, you're welcome to program the exercises in any language you want.

Each directory `list-nn` contains:

 - **README.md** - of which contains the exercises numbered (1-n);
 - **languageFolder** - the language you're going to use;
 - **languageFolder/exercise-nn/exercise-nn.ext** - the exercises should be added inside the language folder

Here's an example:
```
├── fmasanori-lists/
│   ├── list-00/
│   │   ├── go
│   │   │   ├── exercise-00
│   │   │   │   ├── exercise-00.go
│   │   ├── README.md
```

Have fun!
